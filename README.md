### Data Cleaning/Preparation
  In the initial data preparation stage,the following task were performed
  
   - Utilized the text function to derive the year, month, and weekday from the 'date_of_death' field.
  
   - Segregated ages into distinct age groups.
  
   - Substituted empty cells with 'N/A'.

   - standardize the data format in each field, ensuring consistency throughout.
### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
 This includes delving into the data to uncover insights like:
  - Analyze Fatality Trends: Explore the dataset and track the trends in fatalities over time. Identify any significant changes, spikes, or declines in the number of fatalities.
 - Demographic Analysis:Conduct a demographic analysis by examining the age, gender, and citizenship of the individuals killed. Determine if there are any notable patterns or disparities in the data.
 - Geospatial Analysis: Utilize the event location, district, and region information to perform geospatial analysis. Visualize the distribution of fatalities on a map and identify areas that have experienced higher levels of violence.
 - Hostilities Participation Analysis:Investigate the extent of individuals' participation in hostilities before their deaths. Analyze the relationship between participation and the circumstances surrounding each fatality.
 - Injury Analysis: Examine the types of injuries inflicted on individuals. Identify the most common types of injuries and assess their severity.
 - Weapons Used: Analyze the ammunition and means by which the individuals were killed. Determine the most frequently used weapons or methods and evaluate their impact.
 - Victim Profiles: Create profiles of the victims based on the available data such as age, gender, citizenship, and place of residence. Identify common characteristics among the victims.
### Findings/Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
 - July recorded the highest number of fatalities, whereas September had the lowest count. In 2014, there was a spike in deaths, contrasting with a lower count in 2020. Thursdays witnessed the most deaths, while Sundays had the fewest fatalities among weekdays.
- The analysis revealed that 87% of the recorded fatalities were male, while females accounted for 12.9%.
- The highest number of fatalities occurred within the young adult age category compared to other age groups.
- Gaza reported the most fatalities among districts, with North Gaza following closely.
- In the region, the Gaza Strip reported the highest fatalities, exceeding 7000, while the West Bank and Israel recorded 2712 and 679 fatalities, respectively.
- In the distribution of hostility participation, 41.8% of the fatalities were involved in hostilities that led to their death, while 31.7% were not involved in any hostilities leading to their deaths.
- The most prevalent cause of death due to injury was gunfire.
- Missiles resulted in a higher number of fatalities compared to other weapon types used.
